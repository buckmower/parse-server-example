Let's Make Decisions Together

“In order to weigh the merit of our differences we must agree to be equal.”


We are a community that values participation and social cohesion. We care about the opinions of those who have a personal interest in the common property of the community. We like making decisions together!

As a group of people in a similar situation, we organize and make decisions throughout the year to help each other advance. We don’t always have the time to meet in person to make these decisions. We could use help engaging the members and asking for their input in connection with decisions that will be made. 

Represent.xyz will make us a better community by giving each member access to the leadership process, thereby empowering it.

A Represent.xyz sphere is a forum for election administration and participation. Administrators and/or participants in a sphere can create as many elections as they want and submit as many nominations as they so choose. Election pages and pages that represent nominations can be customized with background and profile images and written descriptions. Spheres can have any number of members.


Some Examples

A high school may form a sphere for grades 9-12 to host student council elections for the various council positions. Another sphere for juniors and seniors might host elections regarding the locations of winter formal and prom and themes for those dances. A sphere only for seniors could host elections regarding alumni representative and class gift.

Associations might use Represent.xyz to gather input regarding setting the agenda for an upcoming event. It can also be used for evaluations, so an organization might have an election that asks members to evaluate priorities.

A city council might use Represent.xyz to engage the community in a development project.
